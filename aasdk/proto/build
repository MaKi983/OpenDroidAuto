Build:
  - check that every file in src are in Android.mk FILE_LIST variable
    get file list
        from libs/aasdk/src
        find ./src -type f | grep -v ut.cpp
        put the output in FILE_LIST
        from libs/aasdk/proto-src
        find ./aasdk_proto -type f | grep -v .pb.h
        put the output in PROTO_FILE_LIST
  - compile proto file:
    o download protoc with the same version of protobuf from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases and unzip it in a protoc folder 
    o go inside *.proto file folder and run following command:
  	  /path/to/protoc --cpp_out=./build/ *.proto
      the generated files are under build folder
To compile proto file:
  - download protoc with the same version of protobuf from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases and unzip it in a protoc folder
  - create folder proto-src/aasdk_proto (or delete content if you wanto to rebuild) inside project lib/aasdk
  - go inside *.proto file folder (libs/aasdk/src/aasdk-proto) and run following command:
  	/path/to/protoc --cpp_out=../../proto-src/aasdk_proto *.proto
    the generated files are under proto-src/aasdk_proto folder
